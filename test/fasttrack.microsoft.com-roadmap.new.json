Both the “Share” and “Get a link” command support all three types of links in OneDrive, including anonymous access links (accessible by anyone), company shareable links (accessible to those within your organization) and restricted links (accessible to a custom set of users both in and outside your organization).

What was the 'Sites' page is now the 'SharePoint home' and the “Sites” tile becomes the “SharePoint” tile - same logo, redesigned for a modern, responsive user experience. Clicking into the SharePoint Home displays the recent sites and portals you are most active in and following, recommended sites per the Office Graph, plus company-wide sites promoted by your company. From the SharePoint home, you, too, can create new sites - simple and fast. We’ve made huge improvements in the time it takes to create a site (targeting seconds to create), the flow & integrated value so that it naturally leads to the creation of an Office 365 Group in Azure Activity Directory (AAD), as well as establishing compliance controls for site classification.\n            " }, { "text": "SharePoint mobile app for iOS", "id": "47112", "recentlyUpdated": "True", "recentlyAdded": "False", "statusWithId": "P-47112", "tags": ["SharePoint"], "body": "\n                Your intranet in your pocket, spanning Office 365 and on-premises SharePoint.
